# Bulk RNA-seq – Results

This directory contains the outputs generated by the bulk RNA-seq pipeline.

⚠️ Large intermediate files (e.g., full normalized matrices) are not included in this repository.

## Output description

### normalized/
- `rpk_matrix.tsv` – Gene-length normalized matrix.
- `tpm_matrix.tsv` – TPM-normalized matrix for exploratory analysis.

### figures/
Quality control and exploratory analysis plots:
- Gene length bias (before/after normalization)
- Sequencing depth bias
- Mean–variance relationship
- PCA projection
- Clustering visualization

### Clustering outputs
- `sample_clusters.csv` – Sample-level cluster assignments.
- `contingency_*.csv` – Comparison between inferred clusters and known subtypes.

### sessionInfo.txt
R session information for reproducibility.

## Notes

- All results can be regenerated by running the bulk pipeline script.
- Differential expression analysis should be performed on raw counts using DESeq2 / edgeR / limma-voom.
- Large matrices are not version-controlled to keep the repository lightweight.
