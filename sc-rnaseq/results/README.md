# Single-cell RNA-seq – Results

This directory contains the outputs generated by the Seurat-based scRNA-seq workflow.

⚠️ Large processed objects (e.g., full Seurat `.rds` files) may not be included due to size constraints.

## Output description

### figures/
Diagnostic and exploratory plots:
- QC metrics (nFeature_RNA, nCount_RNA, percent.mt)
- PCA elbow plot
- UMAP visualization colored by clusters
- UMAP visualization colored by provided cell-type annotations

### cluster_markers.csv
Cluster-specific marker genes identified using:
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test
- Minimum 25% detection threshold
- log2 fold change > 0.25

Used for biological interpretation and annotation.

### seurat_processed.rds
Processed Seurat object containing:
- Normalized data
- Variable features
- PCA
- UMAP
- Clustering results

### sessionInfo.txt
R session information for reproducibility.

## Notes

- Results can be regenerated by running the scRNA-seq pipeline script.
- Marker genes are computed after unsupervised clustering.
- UMAP is based on selected principal components.
