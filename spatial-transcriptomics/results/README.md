## Output description

### figures/
- UMAP projections (transcriptomic space)
- Tissue-space visualizations
- Molecule-level visualization
- Spatial similarity heatmaps
- Ligand–receptor interaction dotplots

### celltype_markers.csv
Marker genes per annotated cell type.

### Ligand–Receptor outputs
- Interaction scores based on log fold change
- Spatially weighted interaction scores (centroid-based and neighborhood-based)

### rand_index_clust_vs_celltype.csv
Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index comparing clustering vs annotation.

### spatial_processed.rds
Processed spatial Seurat object.

### sessionInfo.txt
R session information for reproducibility.

## Notes

- Interaction scores are computed as the product of ligand and receptor logFC.
- Spatial weighting integrates centroid distances and neighborhood composition.
- All results can be regenerated by running the spatial pipeline script.
